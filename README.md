# Lilith Game Project

## Overview

Lilith is a game developed using Unreal Engine 5 by a team of five members as part of the Game Studio course for my Master's program at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). The project spanned approximately four months of development.

## My Contributions

As a core member of the team, I was responsible for the following aspects:

### Character Mechanics
- **Main Character Controls:** Implemented mechanics for walking, sprinting, jumping, and rolling (dodging attacks).
- **Combat System:** Developed functionalities for sword attacks, blocking with a shield, and dashing.
- **Interaction:** Added features for interacting with in-game messages and objects by pressing a key.
- **Chests:** Programmed the opening and closing animations of chests, as well as their interaction logic.

### Health and Damage Systems
- **Character and Enemy Health:** Configured the health system for the main character and various enemies.
- **Damage Calculation:** Set damage values for weapons and enemy attacks.
- **Traps:** Implemented damage mechanics for environmental hazards like spikes and exploding mushrooms.

### Animation
- **Attack Animations:** Created three different attack animations for the main character's sword.
- **Enemy Animations:** Developed various attack and death animations for enemies such as skeletons and golems.
- **Cinematic:** Produced the opening cinematic sequence for the game.

### Level Design Assistance
- **Collaborative Design:** Assisted the team member responsible for level design to create immersive and engaging environments.

### Other Features
- **Scene Transitions:** Programmed scene transitions triggered by interacting with specific objects (e.g., pressing a key at an altar).
- **Locked Doors:** Implemented mechanics for finding keys in chests to unlock doors with corresponding animations.
- **Music and Sound:** Integrated background music and sound effects for different scenes.
- **Enemy AI:** Developed enemy AI for tracking, attacking the player, and executing attack animations.

## Conclusion

Working on Lilith was an enriching experience, allowing me to apply and expand my skills in game development, particularly in character mechanics, animation, and interaction systems. This project also enhanced my collaboration and problem-solving abilities within a team setting.

**Note:** The source code for the Lilith project is not available in this repository to protect the intellectual property of the team. However, we may share gameplay videos to showcase the game's features and mechanics in the future.
